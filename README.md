# What is this?

This is my attempt at genuinely understanding Data Structures and Algorithms. I no longer want to be some random code monkey that anyone can just replace when I finally get a job I want.

# Why did you do this in C?

I used C to learn these concepts because it's the language that is mainly taught at my university. It being a low level language also forces me to not rely on built in functions for memory management.
