# Data Structures and Algorithms
<p>These are my practice/exercise code files for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
They are basically just the <br>
array, linked list, cursor-based, computer word, and bit-vector implementations of certain
<b>Abstract Data Structures</b>.</p>

### adtcursorbased.c
Cursor-based implementation of an ADT using *virtual heap* with the following functions:
- initializeVH() - 
- allocSpace() - 
- deallocSpace() -

### arraylist.c
Arraylist implementation of an ADT with the following functions:
- initList() -
- displayList() -
- sortList() -
- changeLetter() -
- insertSorted() -
- deleteAll() -

### list.c
Linked list implementation of an ADT with the following functions:
- initList() - 
- insertLast() -
- displayList() -
