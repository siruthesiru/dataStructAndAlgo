# Data Structures and Algorithms
<p>These are my practice/exercise code files for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.
They are basically just the <br>
array, linked list, cursor-based, computer word, and bit-vector implementations of certain
<b>Abstract Data Structures</b>.</p>

## ADT List
Has the following implementations:
1. Array List
2. Linked List
3. Cursor-Based List

## ADT Stack
1. Array Stack
2. Linked List Stack
3. Cursor-Based Stack

## ADT Queue
1. Array Queue
2. Linked List Queue
3. Cursor-Based Queue

The rest will be added as I study.
